# Cat Program

This is a simple web application that displays an ASCII art representation of a cat, along with a message. The program allows you to click a button to rotate the ASCII art.

## Getting Started

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `cat.html` file in a web browser.
3. The web page will display the ASCII art of a cat along with a "Click me!" button.
4. Click the button to rotate the ASCII art.

## Program Details

The program is built using HTML and JavaScript. The HTML file (`cat.html`) contains the structure and content of the web page. The styling for the elements, including the colors, backgrounds, and layout, is directly included within the `<style>` tags in the HTML file. The JavaScript code embedded in the HTML file (`<script>` element) handles the button click event and toggles the rotation of the ASCII art.
